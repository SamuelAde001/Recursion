# Is palindrome.

## Test if a word is a palindrome. A word is a palindrome if only if it can be read from left to right or from right to left

- start the algorithm
- Declare your variables of the word with the word
- Declare the reverse word variable
- use the reverse srting method to reverse the word and assign it to the reverse word variable
- check if word contains single character of an empty space
- if it contains an empty space or a single character retuen that it is a palindrome
- compare the ending character in each word against the other
- compare the reversed string againt each other to check if the word is a palindrome
- if it is equivalent return that it is a palindrome
- else return is not a palindrome
